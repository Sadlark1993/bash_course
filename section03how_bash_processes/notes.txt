steps:
1 - Tokenization:
    -> quoting: separates tokens in words and operators:
      - words: don't contain unquoted operators;
      - operators: contain at least one...

2 - Command Identification
  -> breaks the command line up into either simple or compound commands
    - simple commands: the commands we've ben using so far (echo, tar...)
      -> a bunch of individual words;
      -> the first word is the command name;
      -> all the other words are arguments to that command.
    
    - compound commands: provides bash with its programming constructs, such as loops, conditionals and etc...

3 - Expansions;

4 - Quote Removal;

5 - Redirection;

finally, bash will execute the command line with what is left over.
